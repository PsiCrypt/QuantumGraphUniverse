**No modern theory makes quantitative predictions in such different experimental contexts. Our approach is the first to link anomalies in quantum processors, colliders and superconductors by a single mechanism**

🌟 **Quantum Graph Theory Makes 5 Precise Predictions** 🌟

We challenge experimentalists to test:
1. 🔬 **1000% error increase** in Shor's algorithm below 50mK
   Formula: `P_error(T) = exp(-T/Tc) + B*(T_graph/T)^1.5`
   
2. ⚛️ **Sharp resonances** at 41.4°/60°/82.8° in FCC scattering
   Formula: `dσ/dΩ = Σ c_k δ(θ - arccos(k/8))`
   
3. ❄️ **London depth jump** in Nb₃Sn: `Δλ_L/λ_L = 1 - d_F^{-0.5}`
   
4. 🔗 **Bell violation decay** to S=2.01 at Δt<10⁻²⁰s
   
5. 📈 **Specific heat peak** at T_graph ≈ 48mK

**Why this matters**:
- First unified explanation across computing, HEP, and condensed matter
- All formulas derived from first principles
- Falsifiable within 1-2 years

Join us in testing reality's code! We offer:
- Collaboration access
- Simulation code
- Theoretical support
