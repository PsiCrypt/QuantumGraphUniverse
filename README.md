Discrete Universe Model: Theory, Predictions, and the Critical Experiment
If successful, this experiment will prove the discreteness of the universe.

📌 Abstract
A new discrete theory of the universe based on the dynamics of a finite directed graph is presented. It alone allows experimental verification of the discreteness of the universe, predicting an anomalous increase in quantum computing errors at ultra-low temperatures (below ~50 mK). An experiment to run Shor's algorithm on a quantum processor cooled to these temperatures can either confirm this fundamental discreteness or disprove the theory. Verification requires roughly two days of quantum computer time.

🧬 Summary of the Theory
1. Basic structure:
Universe = finite directed graph G = (V, E) with |V| ≤ 10^120.


Each vertex holds a bit ϕ ∈ {0,1}.


Each edge carries a topological charge q ∈ {–1, 0, +1}.


2. Graph evolution:
 ϕ(t+1) = U_global ∘ R̂_local(ϕ(t))
Local layer: bitwise Boolean functions.


Global layer: reversible gates (Fredkin/Toffoli).


3. Entanglement via seed string:
 result_a = R̂(σ_ab ⊕ setting_a)
σ_ab length depends on graph complexity: |σ_ab| = ceil[log2(diam(G_ab)/ℓ_p)]


4. Bell and predictions:
 Maximum S ≈ 2 + C / sqrt(|σ_ab|)
 Higher S indicates tighter topological connections at subnuclear scales.


📌 Justification for the Experiment
In standard quantum mechanics, cooling reduces thermal noise exponentially, making error rates tend toward zero. The new graph-based model predicts the opposite: below ~50 mK, error rates sharply increase by orders of magnitude.
Reason: vibrational modes freeze, but topological defects remain active, creating new fundamental noise. This cannot be explained by the continuum model and directly tests the foundations of realism and continuity.
The experiment aims to:
Confirm or refute this prediction.


Explore the limits of standard QM.


Identify a non-thermal error mechanism.


🛠 Why It Hasn’t Been Done Yet
Sub-10 mK industrial cryostats became practical only recently.


Traditionally, lower temperature was expected to improve quantum computing performance, so no one thought to look for worse results.
There was no theory of the discrete universe that allowed such a test.
The predicted rise in errors contradicts standard quantum expectations.



🧪 The Critical Experiment
Goal: Detect a sharp increase in error probability P_error in Shor’s algorithm when temperature T < 50 mK.
Expected effect:
Standard QM: P_error ≈ exp(–T / T_c)


New theory: additional term ~ (T_graph / T)^(3/2)


Protocol:
Use a superconducting quantum processor (IBM, Rigetti,Google Quantum, Microsoft etc.).


Cool it from ~100 mK down to ~5 mK.


Run Shor’s algorithm 10^6 times for small numbers (N=15,21,35).


Measure how error rates change as temperature drops.

❓ What Will Be Falsified
If the experiment finds no anomaly:
This specific discrete graph model, with its concrete mechanism, is falsified, but it will still show the triumph of methodology and the possibility of further reworking the concept (according to Popper)


But the general idea of a fundamentally discrete universe isn’t automatically ruled out; other discrete models may remain possible.


In brief:

✔ Direct test of this specific model + discreteness of the universe


✘ Does not disprove all of digital physics.


Key formula:  P_error(T) ≈ exp(–T / T_c) + B × (T_graph / T)^(3/2)

✅ Conclusion
If this is confirmed, the discreteness of the universe will be fully and forever confirmed, the way to a new discrete mathematics will open; the old continuous models will become special cases.
