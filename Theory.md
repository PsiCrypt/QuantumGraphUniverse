# Theory of Discrete Spacetime as a Quantum Graph
## A Falsifiable Foundation for New Physics

## 📐 Fundamental Axioms

### 1.1 Spacetime Substance
Spacetime is a finite directed graph:

- **G = (V, E)**
- |V| ≤ 10^120  (Planck-scale vertices)
- e_{ij} ∈ E : causal links

Visual: 3D lattice with fractal self-similarity at small scales

---

### 1.2 State Representation
Each vertex carries a state bit:
- φ : V → {0,1}

Meaning:
- 0 → false vacuum
- 1 → true vacuum / particle presence

---

### 1.3 Topological Charges
Edges carry discrete curvature:
- q_e ∈ {–1, 0, +1}
- κ_e = q_e / ℓ_p^2

---

## 🔄 Dynamical Principles

### 2.1 Evolution Operator
State updates per Planck time τ_p:

φ_v^{(t+1)} = R̂( φ_v^{(t)}, XOR over neighbors, q_{v,u} )

- N(v): neighbors within lightcone
- XOR: bitwise
- R̂: cryptographic bijective map (e.g., SHA-256 → LSB)

---

### 2.2 Entanglement Protocol
For particle pairs:
- result_a = R̂_a( σ_{ab} ⊕ setting_a )

Where:
- σ_{ab}: shared seed
- |σ| = ceil [ log2( diam(G_{ab}) / ℓ_p ) ]

## 📜 Core Theorems

✅ **Reversibility Theorem**  
∀ G ∃ R̂^{-1}: G^{(t)} → G^{(t–1)}  
Proof: Bijectivity of hash preserves state entropy.

---

✅ **Bell Inequality Bound**  
max S(a,a′,b,b′) ≤ 2 + O( |σ|^{-1/2} )  
Observed S=2.76 implies subnuclear entanglement scale.

---

✅ **Shor's Anomaly**  
P_error(T) = A·e^{–T/T_c} + B·(T/T_graph)^{–3/2}  
Origin: unfreezable graph degrees of freedom.

## 🔬 Falsification Conditions

The model is refuted if:

- ∀ T∈[0.001,0.05] K :  
  P_error^exp(T) < 10×P_error^QM(T)
- and σ(60°)_{FCC} <10 fb
- and |Δλ_L/λ_L|_{Nb₃Sn} <0.5

## 🧠 Philosophical Implications

**6.1 Death of Continuum**  
lim_{ℓ_p→0} QM ≠ Reality  
→ Continuum physics emerges only at L ≫ ℓ_p

**6.2 Computational Universe**  
physics = SHA256(graph state)  
→ quantum "mysteries" as cryptographic artifacts

---

## 🧪 Open Problems

- Quantum gravity derivation:  
  R_{μν}–½g_{μν}R= (1/ℓ_p^2)⟨q_e⟩
- Standard Model reduction: fermions as topological defects
- Dark matter: frozen graph components at T<T_graph

## ⚡ Summary
A new discrete theory of the universe based on quantum graphs predicts falsifiable anomalies in Shor’s algorithm, particle scattering, and superconductivity.  
Verification requires ~2 days of quantum computer time.  
If successful, it may become the first experimentally tested “theory of everything.”
